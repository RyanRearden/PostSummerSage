I will be using this to map out my progress. The goal by the end of the week is to create a rough draft of the journal paper. My goal is to utilize every single day and make about 60 hours of progress. That's about 8.5 hours per day. If it's split up so from 7am to 12pm and then 8pm to 12am it becomes petty doable. This is all theoretical of course. Here is the laid out schedule:


## Info For Paper
Need: Abstract, Intro, Related Work, Methods, Results, Discussion, Concluding remarks? References. 

Things noted in winning paper: Very nice diagrams and graphics. Clean and explanatory math, Weird note: they use "we" 50 times within an 8-page paper. 71 references were used. 

The use of artificial intelligence (AI)â€“generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements' section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

Good rule of thumb for this paper: Do not use AI in any way to write it just to be safe. Shouldn't be too bad.

Be sure to cite literally everything and make sure that there is no plagarism.
 
Do not go above 8 pages


## For content
From SAGE: Figure out how to check accuracy of model and showcase its abilities. 2 sections: LLM with image description. LLM with data gathering. 

Question to be answered: How

## Week Plan 
Sunday November 24th: Research related work and try to figure out how smart people write papers. Also understand what CheckEMBED is actually doing because it seems pretty magical.

Monday November 25th: Create a series of tests to run on the anlorin. Deploy those tests and check for initial results

Tuesday November 26th: Continue to test and try to wrap up initial data results by that night

Wednesday November 27th: Write the Introduction and synthesize good references. Try to make a related works page as well. 

Thursday November 28th: HALFDAY Try to make some cool graphics

Friday Novermber 29th: Write rough draft of Methods/Experimental Results. 

Saturday November 30th: Write a conclusion and run any extra tests that need to be run

Sunday December 1st: Check everything over and make some small adjustments if needed. Rough draft of paper is finished!

I didn't get a chance to open my computer. Probably a good thing though

It is time to do a lot of stuff. The plan is to read and research for a little bit and then jump right into programming and testing. It is going to be a pretty intense day because I have to catch up from yesterday's work as well. I'll put in a debrief by the end of the day to see how I did. 

Goals: Know what checkEMBED does, learn about the anlorin, run a small job on it to see what happens, write a docker program to run through a bunch of training cases and see what happens, try to use checkEMBED with those training cases. Understand what a good research paper looks like and make notes
