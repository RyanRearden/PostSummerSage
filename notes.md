# Project
From the Forest to the Cloud: Evaluating Edge-Based Image Description Systems for Real-Time Retrieval.

Something cool like this^^ 

## What is interesting about this project:
We are running Florence-2 on the Edge meaning things are a little more sketchy. It's running like crazy and is utilizing a ton of CPU/GPU. But it works and fits which is pretty nice (just barely). I need to explain why Florence-2 is the best model for this job (small and fast and good enough). I want to show how it has a minimal reliance on centralized infrastructure. 

End Goal: Show a novel approach for users to access data that may be difficult to find.

## Types of things to have data on
[] Florence-2 Model Accuracy

[] Gemma2 analysis accuracy

[] Speed of data transmission for a user

[] Raw data Gemma2 analysis (data collection such as, when there are 2 inches of rain, send a photo)

### Florence-2 Model Accuracy
[] Evaluate Omissions, Hallucinations, and Ambiguities

[] Use scoring to prove good or badness

[] Evaluate challenging conditions (blur, low light, etc)

### Gemma2 analysis accuracy
[] Talk about why Gemma2 was used 

[] Evaluate if Gemma2 understood the intent of the user

[] How are ambiguous queries handled

[] Precision@K and Recall@K (idK hahaha :/ )

### Speed of data transmission for a user

[] Evaluate avg response times 

[] Maybe check out remote area impact/network bandwiths

[] Get latency logs and network quality 

### Raw data Gemma2 analysis

[] Trigger-Based analysis

[] Find success rate of retrieval
